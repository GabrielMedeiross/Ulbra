      <h4 class="card-title">History</h4>
      <p class="lead">The story begins as everyone knows: when Bruce Wayne was eight years old and saw his parents murdered in front of him. After this event, he ends up being raised by his tutor, Alfred, who is also the family's butler. The years have passed and Bruce decides to dedicate his life to fight crime. At the age of 14, he traveled the world, attending 8 universities and visiting the East to train in the martial arts. During this period, he also learned healing, hunting and infiltration techniques. Now 26, he returns to Gotham, and assumes the identity of Batman. Robin was created to bring a cheerful and colorful character to Batman's dark and gloomy stories. The creators also imagined that it would be useful to have someone Batman talk to on his adventures (instead of living thinking or talking to himself). Robin was the first example of sidekick in comic books, that is, the idea of ​​a children's partner for an adult superhero, aiming to bring the child audience of readers to the main character. </p>

            <p class="card-text">As bleak as Gotham City can seem, it’s always had at least one ray of light-Robin. The Boy Wonder has long kept Batman from becoming TOO dark of a Dark Knight with his optimism, energy and youthful exuberance. Robin was created to bring a cheerful and colorful character to Batman's dark and gloomy stories. The creators also imagined that it would be useful to have someone Batman talk to on his adventures (instead of living thinking or talking to himself).

            <p class="card-text">Although she was originally introduced to be one of the villains battled by the Batman, her status as a villain is somewhat ambiguous. Selina follows her own moral code (she never kills) and occasionally joins Batman to fight a common threat. Or to ask for help. This forged a strange love / hate bond between them. She made a uniform and, using the skills acquired in her years of bandit life, became a professional thief. That was how Catwoman emerged. </p>
